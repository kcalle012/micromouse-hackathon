          Join us for Montclair's first ever Micromouse Hackathon, where
          innovation meets competition. Teams will design, construct, and
          program autonomous robotic mice that race against the clock to conquer
          a maze in the fastest time possible. Each run is scored based on both
          speed and accuracy, with penalties applied for mapping time and
          errors, and bonuses awarded for clean, untouchable runs.
          <br />
          <br />
          This year‚Äôs contest follows established international standards with
          updated rules to keep the challenge fair and exciting. Competitors are
          given up to 7 minutes to complete a maximum of five runs, with only
          one robot per team permitted. Strategy, precision, and engineering
          skill all play a vital role in determining who will claim victory.
          <br />
          <br />
          üèÜ Prizes will be awarded as follows:
